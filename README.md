## Overview

Gold Rate Prediction using Machine Learning is a technique that leverages historical data and statistical algorithms to forecast future gold prices. By analyzing factors such as previous gold rates, market trends, global economic indicators, and other relevant financial data, the model learns patterns that influence the price of gold. Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost are trained on historical gold price datasets to predict future rates accurately. This approach aids in better financial planning and investment decision-making.

## Usage

This is a basic student-level project designed to understand the concept of Machine Learning. Gold Rate Prediction serves as a practical example of applying machine learning to a real-world financial problem. It demonstrates how historical data can be used to train models that predict future values, helping to explore the fundamentals of data analysis, feature selection, and regression algorithms in a meaningful context.
